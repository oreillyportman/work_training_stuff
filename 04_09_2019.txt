Communication:
	Consulting Skills:
		Barriers to communication:
			(Look in Slack)
			It's important that the sender ensures that their message is clearly understood.
			Barriers to communication lead to messages being distorted in some way.
			
			Communication styles:
				Action- focused on doing things
				Method- focused on facts and process
				People- focused on social interaction
				Ideas- focused on theory and concepts

			Look up Shannon & Weaver comms model

			The Power Of Words:
				Positive words:
					Helpful and constructive
					Tells people what can be done
				Negative words:
					Not helpful and tell you what can't be done
					Subtle tone of blame
				Netural words:
					Wishy-washy

			Mediums of communication:
				What do they need to know and want to hear?
				What is their preferred way to reciving information?
				What will stop them listening to what you have to say?
				How will you know that they have got the message?
				What message warrants formal formal communication?
				What warrants informal communication?

		Interacting with clients:
			Interviewing a client:
				Can be used to both hather requriments for a project as well as build up rapport with the business
				Plan:
					Ensure that you are ready for the interview with a client and know what info you need to get.
					The objective of the interview, the scope, the constraints and the deliverable.
						BOSCARD:
							B - Background
							O - Objectives
							S - Scope
							C - Constraints
							A - Assumptions
							R - Risk
							D - Deliverables
					What type of questions are we asking? 
					What's the purpoese of the interview?
						The 7-point questioning strategy:
							1.Process
							2.Business Rules
							3.Data
							4.Requirements
							5.People
							6.Metrics
							7.Problems
				Prepare
				
					Most important topics first, logical sequence.
					Introduce sensitive topics later in the interview once rapport is established.
					Introduce the topic, ask an opening question, as any follow ups to that questions.
					Where and when is the interview happening,how long will it last, what's the
					purpose, what they need prior to attending?

					Open vs. closed questions:
						Open questions:
							Encourage interviewee
							Help them relax 

						Closed question:
							Helps clarify				
				Conduct
					First impression are extremely important!
					Use the interview plan prepared preiously, build rapport, liste and think quickly.
		`			Summarise the interview, let the interviewee know what's happening next, ask about 
					future interviews if neededm thank them for their time.

					Initial contact and first impressions:
						Introduce yourself, smile and make eye contact

Modelling:
	Modelling techniques:
		We organise our business and their work in a manner that is most convenient for the people in the business rather than the people we serve.
		"Those people who do the same sort of work should be co-located".
		thus all the accountants work together, all IT people work together, all sales folk.
		There is potential for them to work inderpendent silos, oblivious to the effect that their descions have on other parts of the business.
		
		Real processes:
			They start with a request for a good or service from a customer and end with the delivery.
			Nonetheless, the business is still managed in terms of the original....
		
		Process ownership:
			They are not some logical structure invented by the IT departmenty.
			The business must own them, oopetate them and be involved in fixing them.
			The business must understand why process....

		The simple def:
			A process starts with a request for a good or service.... (Look at slides)	
		How we get a process right? (Look at slides)

	Business process modelling notation:
		(Look at sldies) Start (Green circle)
				 Intermedite (Yellow double circle)
				 Stop (Red circle)
	
	Use case diagrams (Look into the slides)
	Class diagrams (Look into the slides)
