NB Gardens Proposal:

	-Introduction to your team.
	-Why you're the right fit for NB Gardens.
	-Individual skills and what each person brings to the team.

	Sean - Mathematics background (optimisation, python and statistical analysis skills, jack-of-all-trades prgrammer)
	Eoghan - Web development background (PHP, SQL, CSS, Javascript and HTML)
	Rob - C# programmer with specific knowledge in design (creative background)
	James - Front end dev (Can deal with user friendly UI, jack-of-all-trades prgrammer)

Why are we suited for MD Gardens?

	They are a company with a highy out-dated sales, stock management and ethos on dealing with the morden 
	gnone customer. This is emphisied by the fact that they lack any form of web-service and an out-dated stock
	from system.
	We are suitable as a team to assist MD Gardens due to our highly varied and morden skill set in tech and software
	to provide creative and contempory soultions to less than contempory problems. 

Hard data on Company:

	Name Of Comp: Nb Gardens
	Location: NW
	Product sold: Garden Gnomes, Gnome accessories and garden ornaments
	Net income: £100,000,000
	# of employees: 600 in dis centre + call centre + head office
	employee breakdown: 100 sales reps (2k orders per day)
	order breakdown: Within 15 min, average value of £200.

Business Transformation Stretegy:

	•To provide a more accurate, pleasant, timely and satisfying experience for each of our customers.
	•To place tight controls on the key information flows within our business processes.
	

Problems:

	A new call centre was integrated in a short time frame and "this has resulted in problems 
	integrating the call centre into the NB Gardens infrastructure and processes" that has caused 
	conflict between stakeholders this issue.

	Changing market tastes (cutting quality for cost) of customers.

	Complains about the IMS implimented by the previous consultants

Soultions proposed:

	Developing a website where orders can be made:

		Pros:
			Cuts out the need for sales operatives in the call centres and allows for more space
			for other types of workers. (Webdevs, customer support, DevOpts).

			Sales are not bottled necked by the # of sales operatives but the # of people 
			attempting to access the site at once.

			Sales are completed by the rate at which the customer completes the transaction on the
			site.

			Will allow easier self-promation- that will provide a platform to phase in the newer cheaper
			gnomes.

		Implamentation:
			(TBA)

	Automated stock updating system:
		
		Pros:
